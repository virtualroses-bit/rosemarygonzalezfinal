            <p> Hello, my name is Rosemary and I am 25 years old. I am currently a senior here at SUNY New Paltz, majoring in Visual Arts with a concentration in Graphic Design. Some of my interests are related to my concentration. For instance, I enjoy creating advertisements and logos for people. On the side, I work with a small business here in the Hudson Valley, designing for a variety of clients. After I graduate, my goal is to work with the design team based at West Point.  
                Some other hobbies and interests that I quite enjoy include collecting vintage dolls, specifically Barbies. Collecting these dolls brings a strong sense of nostalgia because they were a significant part of my childhood. Growing up, I spent the first 11 years of my life in the city. While my family had great moments there, it was time to start a fresh new life here in the Hudson Valley
